# Message App

This is a real-time messaging application using Rails Hotwire. Right now, it can only be run locally. You can run the `start.sh` script to make it easier. The features in this app are:
* Real-time chatting (Able to send and see messages without refreshing the app first)
* Chat with different users that are recorded in the database
* See what, when, and who sent the last message
